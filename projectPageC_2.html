            <p>
              The Moth Classifier is an embedded system that consist of a Raspberry Pi that takes images of moths and uses machine learning algorithms to correctly identify moths and measure the size of them. <br>
              The project consists of three major parts. The first part is an embedded system consisting of a motion triggered camera which will take pictures when it detects the motion of a moth. Next is morphospecies classification, where the images taken will be classified as the correct species of moth. Last is specific species classification. This is where images that are classified as the specific species, Malacasoma Americanum, have size analysis performed on them such as wing span and area so that scientist can use this information to aid in their research. <br>
              My team consisted of three people and we were each assigned to the three different parts. I oversaw the first part, the embedded system that would take the pictures. <br>

              <h4 class="h4_para">September – October 2019</h4> <br>
              I began my part of the project by researching the best way to achieve the embedded system setup. We meet with our potential client, a researcher at a university, to talk more about the process that scientist go through when identifying moths. I came up with a drawn mockup of the system so that I could see what equipment/pieces would need to be purchased. I sent the list to our project manager and made the mockup using a cardboard box. I attempted to use Cron, a Linus scheduler, to run the program every few seconds so that we could capture the images of moths periodically. This was not successful, and I went back to revision stage.
              <h4 class="h4_para">November – December 2019</h4> <br>
              I continued to try to come up with a more intuitive solution to the problem of taking pictures. I was still attempting to do a time-based system. I used the timer function in python to sleep the system before taking more images. My project manager suggested that I look into motion detection to trigger the camera. They said I should use OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, which would give me the capability to do just that without any additional hardware.  By the end of December, I had the system prototype, and it was taking images based on time elapsed. I also integrated AWS S3 buckets with my code to upload images taken on the Raspberry Pi directly to the cloud. I attempted to download OpenCV. I tried many times, but I could not figure out how to download and install the software successfully onto the Raspberry Pi. I instead worked on a 3D print for the system by using Autodesk Fusion 360.

              <h4 class="h4_para">January – March 2020</h4> <br>
              When I got back from winter break, my project manager gave me a Passive infrared sensor (PIR) sensor because OpenCV was not downloading onto the Raspberry Pi. I wrote code so that motion detection with the sensor was working. I was then able to get OpenCV to download and write the code for motion detection with software. I found a useful library created by PyImageSearch which helps with the motion detection image processing for OpenCV. Now the project supports both modes of motion detection. Since I finished my part, I started working on the website design. My team and I began making low fidelity designs on paper to get an idea of what information we would need to have on the website for scientist to properly use. I then used the online tool Figma to come up with a high-fidelity design for the website. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vGS3MnksEpoQZyrMR6v1K9/Me-Moth-and-You?node-id=1%253A2&scaling=min-zoom" target="_blank">Link to Figma Project</a>
              <h4 class="h4_para">April – May 2020</h4> <br>
              Covid-19 closes universities across the country, including mine. Many of the plans of the project had to be stopped to compensate for the limited capabilities at home. We revised some parts of the project after advising from our product manager and turned in our final package.
              <h3 class="h3_para">Future of the Project</h3> <br>
              In the future, the project will be continued by more seniors in the computer science department of my university. We left documentation and specifications to ensure a clear transition between our team to the next. We also outlined additional features that can be made to make a more concrete product for the scientists to use.
