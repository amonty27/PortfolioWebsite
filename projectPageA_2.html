              The client reached out to me to create some banner art for her article on The Hungry Society. It was an interview with the publisher of Cuisine Noir, the first magazine dedicated to highlighting black chefs and the black experience in food, wine, and travel culture. I made a total of 3 images, with an additional three revised for client’s approval.

              I wanted to achieve a feeling of celebration of all that the magazine has accomplished while also staying in theme for the magazine. I created a banner that took the chefs on some cover pages of the magazine from years prior but decided to do a collage instead so that the focus was on the magazine and not the chefs themselves. This is why I feature the title in the center. I kept the original font to help with brand recognizability.

              The client liked the original image but wanted to incorporate more of her brand colors (from the Hungry Society’s warm tones) into the image. She asked if I could add flowers to the original, so I did, but I went ahead and made 2 more images that incorporated the colors she wanted in, which is the one she ended up choosing.
