            <p>
              In a collaborative event hosted by TypeHaus, a discord channel for graphic designers and creatives, the community came together to create a Type Font (Think Times New Roman or Helvetica). Different members assigned other members in the community either a letter or character, sometimes both! The community hosted the event for two weeks. People shared what letters or characters they received and shared their ideas and sketches.

            <p>
              I was assigned the lowercase k and the number 2. I started with many sketches to visualize my work. Getting ideas out on paper is my way of tackling projects. Aiming for something different but still recognizable, I made sketches that were loose to get ideas out quickly. 
              Once I had an idea of what I wanted, I uploaded the images to Adobe Illustrator and began creating vectors. This was not my first-time using illustrator, but I am always finding new ways to do things. I really started to use the shapebuilder tool to combine shapes and shave off excess. It is a great way to make complex shapes using primitive ones.

            <p>
              After I was finished, I submitted my work to the community, where other members put all our letters and characters into one font file. The font team shared the file with the community that we can now use in our other projects. I am delighted with the result and so glad I could create this!
