            <h3 class="h3_para">Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              The reason I wanted to create this website was really to test my skills in HTML and CSS. I recently started teaching myself how to use them, so I can have a good foundation before moving onto JavaScript and JavaScript libraries, like React or Vue. 
              I also wanted a website I could 100% customize, only limited by the skills I have.
              </p> 
              <h3 class="h3_para">Planning</h3>
              <p>  Before I started, I did a lot of research (aka, watching YouTube tutorials). To avoid what others have called “tutorial hell” I quickly started testing out techniques I was learning in HTML. Once I had a very basic understand of different types, formatting, etc., I started writing down everything that would be featured on the site. This included the homepage, the projects, and the about me page. I tried to keep it simple, so I wouldn’t overwhelm myself. I also started jotting down ideas for layout, images, etc. to get an idea of what I wanted. A lot of the ideas that I had seemed to be out of my skill level, but after completing the website, I would like to go back and attempt them. <br>
              Once I decided the basics, I moved on to wire framing my website in Figma. I decided on Figma since it was an application I have used before (on the Moth Classifier project) and I knew I could pick it back up. I first created a Mood Board to get an idea of what colors, fonts, and mood I wanted my project to be. Then I moved onto the webpages themselves. Navigating through Figma itself was not that difficult. It is very similar to Photoshop and Illustrator that I have used before. Any time I faced a problem, I found the solution through Google. 
              (Link to <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/CSWbiWfHn9qr3yY5qCLrUR/Portfolio-Moodboard?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">Figma</a> File)</p>

            <p>
            
              Finally, the daunting part was upon me: creating the webpage.<br>
              At first, I wanted to add JavaScript to my site, but I decided to test the limits with HTML and CSS, so I could really understand it, (also less scary than JavaScript). <br>
              Over a couple of months, I continually updated my pages. Anytime I thought of something I wanted to include, I googled the information. For example, after looking for a way to make a grid format for my webpages to organize them, I discovered CSS Grid and Flexbox. I completely changed how I was organizing elements on the page.

            <p>
              I was able to finish my first webpage! There are countless things I want to do to improve it, but I’m satisfied with my first attempt! It may continue to change over the next couple of months, after I work on some other projects to up my skills. My next plan is to learn JavaScript, so I can begin to use some JavaScript libraries such as React or Vue. Thanks for reading!
